# Movie List

Ive built this app to use my knowldge on React and Redux to practice and build a movie app. <br>
Showcases the current movies that are out, Popular Movies and Upcoming Movies that are coming. <br>
There is also a search box that displays movies with the title or part of the title that was searched. <br>
This app is currently being worked on and soon will be hosted live. <br>
The api that I have used for this project is the MOVIEDB API. <br>
